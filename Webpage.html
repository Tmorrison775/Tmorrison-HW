    <h1>My name is Travis and this is my story</h1>
        <h3>Family life</h3>
            <p>I was born in the city of Sparks, NV. I remember being anti-social but at the same time I Loved to help people oddly enough. This led me to get into martial arts and earn a black belt in Taekwon-do while also doing various community service activities. While in highschool, I got interested with computers and began watching videos on them. I even began to  obsess at points over computers and learned so much along the way. With all of this said, I knew I wanted to make a difference in my life and others more than any passion I had towards technology, so I decided joining the military or doing police work would be my calling in life. I remember training for over a year to lose well over 20 pounds to meet the maximum weight limit to enlist in the United States Army. On November 12, 2012 I was shipped off to Basic Combat Training and to start my new life</p>
        <h3>Life in the military</h3>
            <p>Going through training was hard. I would be a liar if I said I never thought about quitting. I kept those thoughts out of my head most of the time and eventually graduated training and received orders to K-16, South Korea. During my year in K-16, it was one of the few highlights in my life. The country of Korea is beautiful and the people are so kind. I remember being so shocked to see so many nice and smiling faces, even complete strangers at times acted as if we were friends or family. The culture is so different and I fell in love with it. Moving on, I received orders for Fort Irwin, the Worst duty station and experience of my life. Between toxic leadership, horrible hours, roughly 4 days off per month I can say it was hell. Our mission was to train deploying units for combat. The unit was a non-deployable unit however, due to the constant flow of units in need of training, it meant we never had time off. My experience along with injuries contributed greatly to my decision to leave the US Army and life as I knew it.</p>
        <h3>Life after the Army</h3>
            <p>Once I got out of the Army I became a Wind Turbine Technician. I cannot put into words how passionate I am for that career path, and to this day have a hard time talking about it due to regret or sadness from my loss. In December of 2017 I worsened and re-injured a pre-existing injury from military service that ended my career as a wind turbine technician and also any hopes of a physical job such as police work which I always aspired to do after the military. Realizing I can not just give up on life, employment, etc. Even with the VA helping me via disability, I need a new mission, a purpose of sorts, even if it a hobby more than actual employment! Besides even with all my personal hardships I am ONLY 25 years old, I have an entire life to live still and I WONT be spending it disgruntled or upset over something I CANNOT change. Remember me mentioning earlier I had taken interest in computers as a teen? I knew I wanted to get into software development and I still have my GI Bill to spend! I also knew that I DID NOT WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH COLLEGE! So what were my options? I decided to go with SDGKU to learn some basic skills which I plan to build onto through my own research or possibly another training programs with more difficult languages for more experienced programmers. This is where I am today and I am looking forward to adding to my story! </p>
